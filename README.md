# Week 5 project: Your best guess

## Welcome to charades with crazy animals!

This is an application that displays the name and the photo of the anmials received by external API in random.

- A user can:
  - Click skip to next animal.
  - Click next animal to get the point.
  - Swap teams.
  - Start a new game.

## Reflection
It was really difficult to decide what we want to build with the APIs for the project. The team came to an agreement to build a simple game of charades.
Stand-ups were effective and the team worked collaboratively. We managed to hit the MVPs and everyone was satisfied with the outcome.

## Rules
- Team A selects their first player to act out random animals.
- Every animal that the team guesses correctly scores a point.
- The player then generates a new animal.
- If the player can't act out the animal, you can skip and get a new one, without scoring a point.
- After 60 (Demo: 20) seconds, your turn is up, and Team B can choose their first/next player.
- Press 'Swap team' when the player is ready, and the counter will begin.

## Actions
- When the team guesses correctly, put your finger on your nose and point at them with the other hand.
- You can indicate how many words at the start of your turn by holding up the corresponding number of fingers.
- You can then tell your team which word in the sequence that you are acting out.
- To let them know how many syllables in the word, tap your forearm with the number of fingers which the syllable has.
- To move onto another word, hold the corresponding fingers up to your team again.
**Sounds Like**
- With your thumb and one finger, wiggle your ear to indicate the word 'sounds like' whatever you want to act out.
- Once the team guesses the correct 'sounds like' word, show 'correct' (finger on nose and point).
- The team then tries to guess the correct word; until they get the right word, keep rotating your fingers around each other to show that they didn't get it yet.

## Game end
- Once every player in both teams has had their turn, the final scores determine the winning team.
- Press new game to play all over again! Maybe you want to switch up the players in the teams.
